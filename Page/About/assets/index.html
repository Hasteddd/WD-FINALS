        <p><strong>What i'm passionate about:</strong> Hello! I'm passionate about exploring the thrill of riding cars and motorcycles, feeling the rush of speed and control on the road. With a background in Information Technology (BSIT), I've cultivated a deep appreciation for the intersection of technology and automotive design. I enjoy understanding the technological advancements in vehicles and how they integrate with our daily lives. When I'm not on the road, I cherish moments of relaxation, enjoying the art of sleeping and unwinding, which rejuvenates my passion for adventure and exploration.</p>
        <p><strong>My experience:</strong> As a first-year student in BSITWMA (Bachelor of Science in Information Technology with Web and Mobile Application), I'm gaining foundational knowledge in web and mobile development. Familiar with languages like HTML, CSS, and beginning to explore JavaScript, I've started creating basic web pages and experimenting with responsive design. Through coursework, I'm learning about UI/UX principles, frontend development, and the basics of backend technologies. I'm enthusiastic about honing my skills in creating functional and visually appealing web and mobile applications that enhance user experiences.</p>
        <p><strong>My aspirations and goals:</strong> As a student pursuing BSITWMA (Bachelor of Science in Information Technology with Web and Mobile Application), my goal is to master web and mobile development frameworks such as React and Flutter. I aim to gain expertise in UI/UX design principles, backend development, and mobile interface optimization. Ultimately, I aspire to build innovative web and mobile applications that enhance user experiences and contribute to the digital transformation of businesses and industries.</p>
